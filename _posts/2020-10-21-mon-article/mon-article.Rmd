| General topic                        | Camera an Scintifics may overcount snow leopards because of the hardness to distinguish them                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Procedure/ what was examinated       | - Biologists distinguish a snow leopard by looking at his unique pattern's coat + Differents camera angles and light levels can lead to mistakes + Experts and non-experts misidentified photos of snow leopards                                                  |
| Conclusions/discovery                | - Snow leopards population may be overestimated by 35%. - Other big cat species may be in the same case. - They are working on an AI able to distinguish them properly but it has the same problems as the Human eye. - Using more cameras may solve the problems |
| Remaining questions                  | - Are snow leopards still endangered ? - Are there other species in the same case as snow leopards ? - Will we ever been able to distinguish snow leopards properly ?                                                                                             |
