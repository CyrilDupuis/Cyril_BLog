| General Topic                        	| - The impact on whales of compressed air cannons for seismic surveys                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               	|
| Procedure/What was examinated        	| - Air cannons on ships are like fire truck sirens for whales + Compressed air cannons send bursts every 10 to 20 seconds for several days or even months but not continuously + These bursts are 240 DB (1 million times bigger than whale calls and can make whales deaf if they are less than one kilometre away) + These sound waves are low frequency so they can spread to the other side of the world with very little attenuation, which has a series of behavioural impacts on whales dozens of kilometres away + These waves are superimposed on the bandwidth of baleen whales, which masks their calls, they therefore increase their appeal rate in vain 	|
| Conclusions/Discovery                	| - The blue whales and bowhead whales of the Beaufort Sea in Alaska stopped calling each other because they could not hear each other + The recovery of the North Atlantic right whale population is compromised by mortality due to collisions with ships and fishing gear but also by compressed air guns making their vital interactions complicated or even impossible + These waves are an anthropogenic stress factor, can make them deaf and disrupt the behavioural patterns of marine mammals hundreds of thousands of times each year                                                                                                                     	|
| Remaining questions                  	| - Are oil and gas so important that they are destroying these whale populations ? - What is the current situation of these whales, are they still in danger ? - Is there no way to develop a new cannon that is harmless to marine beings ?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        	|
