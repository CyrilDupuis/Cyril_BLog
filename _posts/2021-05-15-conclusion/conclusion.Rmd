After reading these articles, I learned much more than I expected.

My opinion on the situation of the snow leopards was correct, but I was completely wrong about the situation of the maritime world.
The human impact on the marine world is alarming. When you know how many boats exist in the world, the number of animals hit, killed or disturbed must be staggering.
Even if the situation with corals is not as dramatic as we think, the situation with animals is chilling.

Finally, concerning the German peat bogs, I didn't think that global warming was disturbing so many regions close to us.
