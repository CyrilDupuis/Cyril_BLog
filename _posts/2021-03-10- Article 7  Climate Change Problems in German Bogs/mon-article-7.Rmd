| Procedure/ What was examinated       	| - "The Black Forest is experiencing significant drought and heat: rising temperatures and longer dry periods + Peatlands are extremely sensitive to climate change and have a very high proportion of endangered plant and animal species + A study was carried out on almost all meticulously scanned areas over a period of four years and used data from the 1970s on complete peatlands + The data allowed 88 plant species to be analysed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               	|
| Conclusions/ Discovery               	| - Bogs used to be found in northwestern Germany, today only a few healthy ombrotrophic bogs, raised bogs and spring bogs can be found in the Alps and mountain ranges + The same is likely to happen in other low mountain ranges, German regions, habitats or species groups + 2 plant species have disappeared in the last 40 years; populations of many species have decreased by a third; two have become extinct; population sizes of 37 climate-specific species making up a large part of German biodiversity have decreased by about a third since the 1970s; 46 generalist species have coped better with the changes and their numbers have increased over time; losses are greatest where heat and drought are greatest. + The study shows that the greatest disturbance factor is climate change. 	|
| Remaining questions                  	| What about other European peatlands ? - Do we need to take radical action right now to conserve these peatlands ?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             	|
